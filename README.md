# EventIntelligence
This repository has a script to quickly extract event intelligence from a given location in a time frame.

What is Event Intelligence?
It is the technology to provide events visibility that is likely to impact a business and deeper insights on what events have impacted business in the past and likely to impact similarly in future. This is a powerful Outside Metric that can drive sales of a particular business. It can help businesses predict demand curves of their products or services. It is one of the factors that can help businesses explain past surges or dips in their sales value.

What was that, again?
A data-savvy dispensary in Seattle wants to explain certain surges in their sales on 11/26/2017. It is a random spike following no seasonality or obvious patterns. Modelling normal attributes like day, time, sales-1(lagged sales point by day/ week/ month) does not explain more than 30%-40% of the variance in sales data. That very day, there was a game of Seattle SeaHawks. Did that effect the sales? Do such events affect normally affect sales? Can the dispensary better predict demand if it has the intelligence to somehow figure out the happening of such an event in the area. That is just one use case where Event Intelligence can be used. For a better understanding, there is a great article here(https://www.predicthq.com/blog/what-is-event-intelligence/).

The repository contains script to extract event data and is dependent on developer APIs from https://www.predicthq.com. It is a great set of APIs with lot of functionalities and flexibility to extract data. Check them out!

Happy Analyzing!!
